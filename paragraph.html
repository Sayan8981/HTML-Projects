    <h1>Heading One</h1>
    <p id='paragraph'> Tim Ambrose, the former England wicket-keeper, announced that he would retire from professional cricket at the end of the 2020 season on Friday (July 3). The 37-year-old said it has been an 'honour and privilege' to play for Warwickshire County Cricket Club.

Ambrose started his career in 2001 with Sussex but his best years came at Warwickshire, where he moved to in 2006. He won four domestic competitions across formats, has the second most dismissals for the club and also won his England cap while playing for the county side.

"I have decided, that after 20 years, it is time for me to retire from cricket and Warwickshire County Cricket Club. I will say the usual words of 'honour and privilege' but will know that to me they don't quite convey my gratitude for the opportunity I have had.

"I still very much consider myself a part of this squad and fully intend to fulfil my role for the remainder of the 2020 season."

Ambrose made his England debut in 2008 against New Zealand at Hamilton and went on to score his maiden hundred in only his second Test. He played 11 Tests, five ODIs and a solitary T20I for England.

"It is a difficult thing to accept as I would love to play another 20 years, if it was at all possible, but it is the right time for this talented, energetic and ambitious young squad to move forward and make their own mark. I have always tried to put the club and the team first and to not make this decision now would go against that," he said.

Paul Farbrace, Sport Director at Warwickshire CCC, said: "Tim has been one of the great wicket-keeper/batsmen of the modern game and he will retire at the end of this year as a true Warwickshire legend.

"He's a model professional and, by playing out the 2020 season, we will ensure that he has a very fitting farewell before he moves on to his next challenge. </p>
